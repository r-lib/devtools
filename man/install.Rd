\arguments{
\item{pkg}{The package to use, can be a file path to the package or a
package object.  See \code{\link[=as.package]{as.package()}} for more information.}

\item{reload}{if \code{TRUE} (the default), will automatically attempt to reload
the package after installing. Reloading is not always completely possible
so see \code{\link[pkgload:unload]{pkgload::unregister()}} for caveats.}

\item{quick}{if \code{TRUE}, skips some optional steps (e.g. help
pre-rendering and multi-arch builds) to make installation as fast
as possible.}

\item{build}{if \code{TRUE} (the default), \code{\link[pkgbuild:build]{pkgbuild::build()}}s the package
first. This ensures that the installation is completely clean, and
prevents any binary artefacts (like \file{.o}, \code{.so}) from appearing
in your local package directory, but is considerably slower, because
every compile has to start from scratch.

One downside of installing from a built tarball is that the package is
installed from a temporary location. This means that any source references
will point to dangling locations and debuggers won't have direct access to
the source for step-debugging. For development purposes, \code{build = FALSE} is
often the better choice.

If \code{FALSE}, the package is installed directly from its source
directory. This is faster and can be favorable for preserving source
references for debugging (see \code{keep_source}).}

\item{args}{An optional character vector of additional command line
arguments to be passed to \verb{R CMD INSTALL}. This defaults to the
value of the option \code{"devtools.install.args"}.}

\item{quiet}{If \code{TRUE}, suppress output.}

\item{dependencies}{What kinds of dependencies to install. Most commonly
one of the following values:
\itemize{
\item \code{NA}: only required (hard) dependencies,
\item \code{TRUE}: required dependencies plus optional and development
dependencies,
\item \code{FALSE}: do not install any dependencies. (You might end up with a
non-working package, and/or the installation might fail.)
See \link[pak]{Package dependency types} for other possible values and more
information about package dependencies.
}}

\item{upgrade}{When \code{FALSE}, the default, pak does the minimum amount
of work to give you the latest version(s) of \code{pkg}. It will only upgrade
dependent packages if \code{pkg}, or one of their dependencies explicitly
require a higher version than what you currently have. It will also
prefer a binary package over to source package, even it the binary
package is older.

When \code{upgrade = TRUE}, pak will ensure that you have the latest
version(s) of \code{pkg} and all their dependencies.}

\item{build_vignettes}{if \code{TRUE}, will build vignettes. Normally it is
\code{build} that's responsible for creating vignettes; this argument makes
sure vignettes are built even if a build never happens (i.e. because
\code{build = FALSE}).}

\item{keep_source}{If \code{TRUE} will keep the srcrefs from an installed
package. This is useful for debugging (especially inside of RStudio or
Positron). Defaults to \code{getOption("keep.source.pkgs") || !build},
since srcrefs are most useful when the package is installed from its
source directory, i.e. when \code{build = FALSE}.}

\item{force}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}} No longer used.}

Uses \verb{R CMD INSTALL} to install the package, after installing needed
dependencies with \code{\link[pak:local_install_deps]{pak::local_install_deps()}}.

To install to a non-default library, use \code{\link[withr:with_libpaths]{withr::with_libpaths()}}.
