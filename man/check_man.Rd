\title{Check documentation, as \verb{R CMD check} does.}
\usage{
check_man(pkg = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{The package to use, can be a file path to the package or a
package object.  See \code{\link[=as.package]{as.package()}} for more information.}
}
\value{
Nothing. This function is called purely for it's side effects: if
no errors there will be no output.
}
\description{
This function attempts to run the documentation related checks in the
same way that \verb{R CMD check} does. Unfortunately it can't run them
all because some tests require the package to be loaded, and the way
they attempt to load the code conflicts with how devtools does it.

\dontrun{
check_man("mypkg")
