## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.1.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.1.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
  Namespace in Imports field not imported from: 'R6'

  R6 is a build-time dependency.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of httr 
(https://github.com/wch/checkresults/blob/master/httr/r-release). All packages 
that I could install passed except:

* XYZ:...
