### foofactors

Factors are a very useful type of variable in R, but they can also drive you nuts. This package provides some helper functions for the care and feeding of factors.

### Installation

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jennybc/foofactors")
```
  
### Quick demo

Binding two factors via `fbind()`:

```{r}
library(foofactors)
a <- factor(c("character", "hits", "your", "eyeballs"))
b <- factor(c("but", "integer", "where it", "counts"))
```

Simply catenating two factors leads to a result that most don't expect.

```{r}
c(a, b)
```

The `fbind()` function glues two factors together and returns factor.

```{r}
fbind(a, b)
```

Often we want a table of frequencies for the levels of a factor. The base `table()` function returns an object of class `table`, which can be inconvenient for downstream work. Processing with `as.data.frame()` can be helpful but it's a bit clunky.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
x <- factor(sample(letters[1:5], size = 100, replace = TRUE))
table(x)
as.data.frame(table(x))
```

The `freq_out()` function returns a frequency table as a well-named `tbl_df`:

```{r}
freq_out(x)
```
