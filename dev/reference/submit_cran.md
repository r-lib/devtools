# Submit a package to CRAN

This submits your package to CRAN using the web-form submission process.
After submission, you will receive an email asking you to confirm
submission

- this is used to check that the package is submitted by the maintainer.

You may prefer to use `submit_cran()` indirectly, by calling
[`release()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/dev/reference/release.md)
instead.
[`release()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/dev/reference/release.md)
performs many checks verifying that your package is indeed ready for
CRAN, before eventually asking for your confirmation that you'd like to
submit it to CRAN (which it does by calling `submit_cran()`).

Whether to use
[`release()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/dev/reference/release.md) or
`submit_cran()` depends on the rest of your development process. If you
want to be super cautious, use
[`release()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/dev/reference/release.md), even
though it may be redundant with other checks you have performed. On the
other hand, if you have many other checks in place (such as automated
checks via GitHub Actions and the task list generated by
[`usethis::use_release_issue()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_release_issue.html)),
it makes sense to use `submit_cran()` directly.

## Usage

``` r
submit_cran(pkg = ".", args = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- pkg:

  The package to use, can be a file path to the package or a package
  object. See
  [`as.package()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/dev/reference/as.package.md)
  for more information.

- args:

  An optional character vector of additional command line arguments to
  be passed to `R CMD build`.
