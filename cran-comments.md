This is a small patch fixing test failures on CRAN

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R-oldrel, R-release, R-devel
* Windows Server 2012 R2 (x64), R 3.5.1
* Rhub
  * Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit
  * Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 ERRORs | 0 WARNINGs | 0 NOTES.

## Downstream dependencies

* I did not test all dependencies, but do not think any of the changes should effect them.
