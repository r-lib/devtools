* new `wd` function to change the working directory to a package subdirectory.

* on Windows, `devtools` now checks for the presence of `Rtools` on startup,
  and will automatically add it to the path if needed.

* use `roxygen2` instead of `roxygen` for documentation

* `reload` now will only reload if the package is already loaded, and
  `install_github` will automatically reload if needed.

* `dev_mode` will create directories recursively, and complain if it can't
  create them.

* `document` has new parameter `clean` which clears all roxygen caches and
  removes all existing man files. `check` now runs `document` in this mode.

* `check_doc` now checks package documentation as a whole, in the same way
  that `R CMD check` does, rather than low-level syntax checking, which is
  done by `roxygen2. DESCRIPTION checking has been moved into `load_all`.

* `test` automatically reloads code

* `build` is now exported, and defaults to building in the package's parent
  directory. It also gains a new `binary` parameter controls whether a binary
  or a source version (with no vignettes or manuals) is built. Confusingly,
  binary packages are built with `R CMD INSTALL`.

* `install_github` now allows you to specify which branch to download

devtools 0.3
------------

* new `bash()` function that starts bash shell in package directory. Useful if
  you want to use git etc.

* removed inelegant `update_src()` since now superseded by `bash()`

* fix bug in ftp upload that was adding extraneous space

* `build` function builds package in specified directory. `install`, `check`
  and `release` now all use this function.

* `build`, `install`, `check` and `release` better about cleaning up after
  themselves - always try to both work in session temporary directory and
  delete any files/directories that they create

devtools 0.2
------------

* `install_github` now uses `RCurl` instead of external `wget` to retrieve
  package. This should make it more robust wrt external dependencies.

* `load_all` will skip missing files with a warning (thanks to suggestion from Jeff Laake)

* `check` automatically deletes `.Rcheck` directory on successful completion

* Quote the path to R so it works even if there are spaces in the path.

devtools 0.1
------------

* Check for presence of `DESCRIPTION` when loading packages to avoid false
  positives

* `install` now works correctly with `devel_mode` to install packages in your
  development library

* `release` prints news so you can more easily check it

* All `R CMD xxx` functions now use the current R, not the first R found on
  the system path.
